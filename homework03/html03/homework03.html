                Lago di Luzzone is a reservoir in Ticino, Switzerland. The reservoir 
                has a volume of 108 million m³ and a surface area of 1.27 km².
                It is located in the upper Blenio valley, on the territory of the
                municipalities of Ghirone and Aquila.
                The reservoir lies at a height of 1,606 metres above sea level 
                and is surrounded by peaks over 3,000 metres. The highest is 
                Piz Terri (3,149 m), on the north-east side of the lake, seconded 
                by the Plattenberg (3,041 m), on the east side. The Torrone di Nav (2,832 m) 
                overlooks the lake from the south side while Pizzo Pianca (2,377 m) 
                overlooks the lake from the north side.

            <p>The arch dam Luzzone was completed in 1963. In the years 1997–1998, 
                its height was increased by 17 m.One wall of the dam currently 
                features the world's highest artificial climbing wall. A German 
                manufacturer of climbing holds installed a line of over 650 artificial
                holds and bolts. The course covers a vertical distance of 165 meters, 
                going from the base of the dam to the top.The climb must be done
                as a sport climb, in multiple pitches. Furthermore, the lowest holds
                were placed several meters above the ground to deter casual visitors 
                from climbing on them.

              Hallstatt, Upper Austria, is a village in the Salzkammergut, a region
              in Austria. It is located near the Hallstätter See (a lake). At the 2001 census, 
              it had 946 inhabitants. Alexander Scheutz has been mayor of Hallstatt since 2009.
              Hallstatt is known for its production of salt, dating back to prehistoric 
              times, and gave its name to the Hallstatt culture, a culture often 
              linked to Celtic, Proto-Celtic, and pre-Illyrian peoples in Early Iron Age Europe, 
              c.800–450 BC. Some of the earliest archaeological evidence for
              the Celts was found in Hallstatt.

                There are to date no recorded notable events that took place in
                Hallstatt during Roman rule or the early Middle Ages. In 1311, 
                Hallstatt became a market town, a sign that it had not lost its
                economic value. Today, apart from salt production, which since 1595
                is transported for 40 kilometres from Hallstatt to Ebensee via
                a brine pipeline, tourism plays a major factor in the town's economic life. 
                Tourists are told that Hallstatt is the site of "the world's 
                oldest pipeline", which was constructed 400 years ago from 13,000 hollowed
                out trees. There is so little place for cemeteries that every
                ten years bones used to be exhumed and removed into an ossuary,
                to make room for new burials. A collection of elaborately decorated 
                skulls with the deceased's name, profession, date of death inscribed
                on them is on display at the local chapel.
